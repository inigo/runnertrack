    <p>Please enter a comma-separated list of runner identifiers that you'd like to track. Note that these
        are usually not the same as the runner's race number, although this depends on the race. Instead,
        these are the identifier used on the race's tracking site - e.g. for Manchester, it is the
        "AId" value in this URL: "http://www.chiprace.co.uk/MyResults.aspx?CId=38&RId=932&EId=1&AId=26148"
